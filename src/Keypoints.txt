First build the header component
Then sidebar
and then router for chat channels routing

For header component there are three elements
so divide them in three divs this way flexboxing is ez and clean

header left, center and right
for header include avatar and time icon
define a slack color variable in app.css 
to be used across the app
now building the sidebar component inside a div coz 
we need to wrap it in the router later on

creating the sidebar
create the sidebar header and inside that
wrapping the name and online icon with sidebar info

creating the sidebar option component
inside the sidebar option pass an icon
and only render it if it exists

setup firebase and create a document of rooms in firebase database
create a collection rooms
created a document of name with value youtube
created another document of name general
inside general created a collection of messages 
which have a structure for every message.

in sidebarjs on mount take the snapshot of the db collection of rooms
it also gives back the modified, deleted or added data whenever
something changes in the firebase db

get the rooms and loop through all the docs in it
and return its id in the object

now implementing react router to swtich btw channels

couldnt get firebase v9 to work with onSnapshot
so had to switch back to firebase v8

wrapped the chat functionality in the router 
to switch btw chat screens

use useParams to get the params from url to get 
the roomid

created Chat component and created two headers div left
and right for the chat window header

now implement add channel feature in Sidebar option

created two functions of addChannel and select channel
selected channel will be pushed into history 
and for addChannel the input from the prompt will create
the channel in the db

addChannel will be called if the addChannelOption prop
is sent into the SidebarOption and if id passed Then
select channel

now in the Chat component we get the channel data
from the db whenever the component loads or whenver the 
roomId changes

on select channel url is changed, useParams get the roomid
and then db get the data for that id and also get the 
messages for that channel

created the Message component to be loaded and mapped in the
Chat component
