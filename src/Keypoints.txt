First build the header component
Then sidebar
and then router for chat channels routing

For header component there are three elements
so divide them in three divs this way flexboxing is ez and clean

header left, center and right
for header include avatar and time icon
define a slack color variable in app.css 
to be used across the app
now building the sidebar component inside a div coz 
we need to wrap it in the router later on

creating the sidebar
create the sidebar header and inside that
wrapping the name and online icon with sidebar info

creating the sidebar option component
inside the sidebar option pass an icon
and only render it if it exists

setup firebase and create a document of rooms in firebase database
create a collection rooms
created a document of name with value youtube
created another document of name general
inside general created a collection of messages 
which have a structure for every message.

in sidebarjs on mount take the snapshot of the db collection of rooms
it also gives back the modified, deleted or added data whenever
something changes in the firebase db

get the rooms and loop through all the docs in it
and return its id in the object

now implementing react router to swtich btw channels

couldnt get firebase v9 to work with onSnapshot
so had to switch back to firebase v8
